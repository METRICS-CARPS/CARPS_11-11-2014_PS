For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section of Experiment 1.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Manipulation checks revealed that reported pain intensity
was higher in the pain condition (M = 6.07, SD =
1.99) than in the no-pain condition (M = 1.67, SD = 0.92),
t(52) = 10.41, p < .001. Reported unpleasantness was also
greater in the pain condition (M = 6.00, SD = 1.96) than
in the no-pain condition (M = 1.74, SD = 1.19), t(52) =
9.63, p = .001. There were no significant differences
between conditions in positive affect (pain condition:
M = 3.05, SD = 0.82; no-pain condition: M = 2.80, SD =
0.83), t(52) = 1.09, p = .283, or negative affect (pain condition:
M = 1.34, SD = 0.45; no-pain condition: M = 1.27,
SD = 0.37), t(52) = 0.60, p = .554. Compared with the
control tasks, the pain tasks were viewed as marginally
more threatening (pain tasks: M = 1.36, SD = 0.58; control
tasks: M = 1.11, SD = 0.30), t(52) = 1.97, p = .054, but not
more challenging (pain tasks: M = 2.67, SD = 0.87; control
tasks: M = 2.37, SD = 0.91), t(52) = 1.22, p = .227.
We predicted that participants who shared a painful
experience, compared with those who shared a similar
but nonpainful social experience, would feel more
bonded together. A one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) revealed that pain had a medium-sized effect
on bonding, F(1, 52) = 4.09, p = .048, d = 0.54 (see Fig. 1);
participants in the pain condition reported higher bonding
(M = 3.71, SD = 1.01, 95% confidence interval, or CI =
[3.33, 4.09]) than did those in the no-pain condition (M =
3.14, SD = 1.09, 95% CI = [2.73, 3.55]).
